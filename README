Fusion Table Searchable Map Template by Derek Eder
Version 1.2
Updated 11/6/2011

After receiving several requests for a walkthrough for creating searchable maps with Fusion Tables, I decided to create this template to help get people started. It includes the basic setup to display a fusion table map and do simple address and radius searches. Once you have this working, feel free to look at my other maps to see how I added the additional filters.
